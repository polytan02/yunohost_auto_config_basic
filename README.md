## Latest news 
* Now available in french ! Disponible en franÃ§ais ! 
* Indiquez simplement fr lors de la demande de la langue
 
* Maintenant compatible Debian Jessie ! (en plus de Wheezy)
* Now compatible with Debian Jessie ! (on top of Wheezy)


## Installation
To copy these files on your server, simply do:

``apt-get update``

``apt-get install git``

``git clone https://github.com/polytan02/yunohost_auto_config_basic``

``cd yunohost_auto_config_basic/``
 
## What script to use ?
* If you want to install Yunohost on a fresh Debian, start from script 1 and then run script 2 :

``./1_git_clone_and_install_YunoHost.sh``
then
``./2_master_configuration_script.sh``

* If you already installed a fresh Yunohost on a fresh then you can start from the master script (number 2) :

``./2_master_configuration_script.sh``

* This being said, each script is independant, so feel free to just run the one you want, for example :

``./8_great_colours_bash_gnuscreen_tmux.sh``

## SSL and HDparam
If you choose to run the SSL script (number 4), note the following : 
* Place your ssl private key in PEM format in subfolder "conf_ssl/DOMAIN.TLD/"  
and name it ==> key.pem 

* Also, place your combined crt file in PEM format in subfolder "conf_ssl/DOMAIN.TLD/"   
and name it ==> crt.pem  
 
 
* Please note that the ssl script can also let you enable dhparam for nginx (and generates the pem file, which can take some time depending on your CPU) 
 
## OpenDKIM
Lastly, if you already have your OpenDKIM key (mail.txt and mail.private) for DOMAIN.TLD, simply place them in folder ./conf_opendkim/DOMAIN.TLD/  
DOMAIN.TLD has to be an existing domain configured by yunohost.
