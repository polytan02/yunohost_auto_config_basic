# Customize the hardstatus line, reserving the last line of the
# display for it even if the terminal supports it. The string that we
# use makes screen show the hostname, time and current windows, using
# red background for the one that is marked as active. This command is
# a slightly modified version of that in Rafael Magana's screenrc:
# https://github.com/rafmagana/screenrc
#
# %{gk} sets text color to green and background to black
# %H is the hostname of the system
# %= pads the string to the display's width (like TeX's hfill)
# %{wk} sets text color to white and background to black
# The part to the next '%?' is displayed only if a '%' escape inside
# the part expands to a non empty string
# %-Lw is the current window
# %{wr} sets text color to white and background to red
# %n is the window number
# %f is the flags of the window
# %t is the window title
# (%u) is all other users on this window
# %+Lw is the window starting after the current one
# %{g} sets text color to green
# %{B} sets the 'blinking' attribute
# %Y-%m-%d are the full year, month and day numbers
# %{w} sets text color to white
# %c is the current time HH:MM in 24h format
#
# The whitespace after the second %{wk} is required to disable the red
# background even if there is not anything else to display (i.e., when
# the last window is also the active one).

# Enable dynamic windows titles. The "$ " part must match the end of
# our shell prompt. We must modify .bashrc so that our shell sends a
# null title-escape-sequence when $TERM is 'screen'. Screen uses this
# escape sequence to identify the command being run and replace the
# title of our current window.  "|bash", on the other hand, defines
# the default name for the shell window. For more details, see:
